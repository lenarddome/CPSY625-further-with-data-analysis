# What do we focus on today?

Today we will explore more advanced topics in data analysis.

1. Experimental Design and Data Preprocessing
2. Counting Responses (Contingency Tables)
3. Within-Subject Differences and Interactions (ANOVA)
4. Statistical Predictions (Regression, Linear Models)

# Contingency Tables

Imagine that there was a large influx of new kids in nurseries in Devon.
And you need to develop a set of activities for nurseries in different communities across different towns.
The goal of this activity to nurture friendships and inclusion at such a crucial developmental age.

This is not an easy task.
You nonetheless need to make sure that you allocate your resources efficiently.
The first thing that you probably want to determine is **how many activities you need to design.**
It is highly likely that at least one of those nurseries will have different culture than the other.

.footnote[

.bold[*] This scenario bears resemblance to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/0165025408089271) and data that you will see in the relevant worksheet later.

#### Problem

We need to determine if each nursery needs their own intervention.
Are their different cultures within the nurseries?

# Contingency Tables

While designing the questionnaires, you imagine your results will likely be organised like this:

|           | activity | feelings | helping | length | norms | trust |
| :-------- | -------: | -------: | ------: | -----: | ----: | ----: |
| Nursery 1 | 47       | 33       | 52      | 28     | 28    | 8     |
| Nursery 2 | 75       | 19       | 26      | 58     | 6     | 12    |
| Nursery 3 | 78       | 17       | 13      | 62     | 6     | 20    |
| Nursery 4 | 55       | 27       | 42      | 44     | 13    | 15    |

The statistics we will look at for this type of data are [<b><span class="texhtml">Ï‡<sup>2</sup></span> test</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) and Bayes Factor for Contingency Tables **(preferred method)**.

# Worksheets

Here are the worksheets in the order you should go through them.
They are part of [RMINR](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/#vbgtr), that has been developed at the University of Plymouth as an in-house teaching material.
The last worksheet is part of [lifesavR](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/).

* [Relationships](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/chi.html): Frequency and contingency tables. Mosaic plots. Traditional chi-square test. Bayesian test.
* [Within-subject differences](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/anova1.html): data preprocessing (pivoting and mutating). One-factor within-subject Bayesian ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons, multiple comparisons.
* [Making Predictions](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/session-6.html): linear regression, scatterplots, three main assumptions for regression.

# Additional Resources

* [Contingency Tables for More Thorough Comparisons](https://danmaclean.github.io/bayes_factors/bayes_proportion.html): in case you want to compare the groups of counts in multiple different ways, this brief worksheet gives some suggestions on how to do it.
* [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/): This is a free online textbook that also has a downloadable [PDF](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) version. The book emphasizes statistical techniques that we try to avoid nowadays, but it nonetheless provides insight into the inferential statistical thinking we all practice.
