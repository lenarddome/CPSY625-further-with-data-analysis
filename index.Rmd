# What do we focus on today?

Today we will explore more advanced topics in data analysis.

1. Experimental Design and Data Preprocessing
2. Counting Responses (Contingency Tables)
3. Within-Subject Differences and Interactions (ANOVA)
4. Statistical Predictions (Regression, Linear Models)

# Worksheets

Here are the worksheets in the order you should go through them.
They are part of [RMINR](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/#vbgtr), that has been developed at the University of Plymouth as an in-house teaching material.
The last worksheet is part of [lifesavR](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/).

* [Relationships](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/chi.html): Frequency and contingency tables. Mosaic plots. Traditional chi-square test. Bayesian test.
* [Within-subject differences](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/anova1.html): data preprocessing (pivoting and mutating). One-factor within-subject Bayesian ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons, multiple comparisons.
* [Understanding Interactions](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/anova2.html): Learn what an interaction is, and learn how to do line plots at the same time.
* [Making Predictions](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/session-6.html): linear regression, scatterplots, three main assumptions for regression.

# Additional Resources

* [Contingency Tables for More Thorough Comparisons](https://danmaclean.github.io/bayes_factors/bayes_proportion.html): in case you want to compare the groups of counts in multiple different ways, this brief worksheet gives some suggestions on how to do it.
* [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/): This is a free online textbook that also has a downloadable [PDF](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) version. The book emphasizes statistical techniques that we try to avoid nowadays, but it nonetheless provides insight into the inferential statistical thinking we all practice.
* [Bayesian ANOVA for PROS](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/anova5.html):  doing two-factor within-subjects Bayesian ANOVA better.
